# Implementation-of-Rabin-Karp-Algorithm-for-String-matching
### Principle: 
1. This method is based on mathematical formulation used to convert pattern and substring into numerical value.
2. Instead of comparing individual character of string and pattern numerical value of pattern and string is compared.
3. Generalizations of the same idea can be used to find more than one match of a single pattern, or to find matches for more than one pattern. 
### What does this .java files contains ? 
<p>ADS_ASSIGNMENTFINAL.java contains the main method.</p>
<p>prime.java contains prime class in which a methods generate_prime is defined for generation of prime number.</p>
<p>print_index.java contains print_index class in which print method is defined.</p>
<p>ssum.java contains ssum class under which sum and sub_sum methods are defined.</p>
<p>search.java contains search class in which search_pattern method is defined to find that the string contains pattern or not.</p>
